# Angular Blog - Sector 67

## 🌐 Description

Simple blog developed during an [Angular Course](https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/dio_formacao_angular) I've taken to learn about how single page applications work in the Angular development environment. Instead of following a 1:1 approach from the teacher, I made the blog responsive, used more optimized CSS, and incremented the data of the blog using generative AI for both text and photos. Have fun reading through articles from inidivuals of a fake galactic sector.
