  <p class="about__paragraph">
    Sector 67, a beacon of information in the vast expanse of the cosmos, was
    established by the enigmatic Blipthrox. Born on the floating islands of
    Pulsar-6, Blipthrox was always fascinated by the mysteries of the universe.
    His insatiable curiosity led him to travel across galaxies, exploring
    strange new worlds and civilizations.
  </p>
  <p class="about__paragraph">
    During his travels, Blipthrox realized that there was a lack of a
    centralized source of information about the various happenings in the
    universe. He envisioned a platform where inhabitants of all planets could
    share their stories, their discoveries, and their experiences. This vision
    led to the creation of Sector 67.
